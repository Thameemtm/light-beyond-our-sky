# 🌠 Light Beyond Our Sky

### A poetic data-driven storytelling project for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**

---

## 🪐 Overview
**Light Beyond Our Sky** is a creative data storytelling project that connects **astronomy and human emotion** through real NASA telescope data.  
Using open datasets from the **Hubble** and **James Webb Space Telescopes**, we built a mixed-media experience that blends scientific imagery, narration, and visualization to show how light from distant galaxies tells the story of our shared existence in the universe.

---

## 🎯 Challenge Focus
This project addresses the challenge of **"Data Storytelling"** — turning complex astronomical data into an engaging and meaningful narrative that anyone can understand and feel connected to.

---

## 💡 What We Developed
We created a short multimedia presentation that combines:
- Real telescope imagery and spectral data from NASA archives  
- Poetic narration describing humanity’s relationship with the cosmos  
- Visual storytelling through slides and animations  
- A simple data visualization showing how light travels across time  

Our goal is to inspire curiosity and connect science with human imagination.

## 🌌 Why It Matters
Space data often feels distant and technical. *Light Beyond Our Sky* transforms this data into a **story of connection and wonder**, helping people see science as something deeply human.  
It encourages learners, creators, and dreamers to view data as a narrative — one that unites everyone under the same sky.
